"Adaptation to changing environments across real geographies"

How locally adaptive alleles arise and spread is well-understood on
ideal, 1- or 2-dimensional "billiard table" landscapes,
but real species may have to spread adaptive innovations across
geographic barriers on many scales.  I examine how a range of habitat
shapes
inspired by real California geographies affect the speed, parallelism,
and probability of evolutionary rescue.
