Points to cover
===============

* General considerations and background
    - evolutionary rescue: Hermisson, Kirkpatrick
    - new mutation / standing variation
    - both dependent on pop size, but in different ways
    - parallelism and architecture

* Rapid climate change and ecological dynamics
    - population size changes affect available variation
    - moving environmental gradients might pull locally adaptive alleles along with them
    - single rescuing allele across an entire range has to be (unreasonably?) *fast*
    - heterogeneity introduces possibly advantageous alleles in more places

* Local establishment and drift
    - local structure affects probability of establishment
    - and also amount of available neutral variation

* Spread of adaptations
    - will rescue occur, if populations are declining?
    - if environments are shifting?


Speed of adaptation : Race against time/change

How do adaptations cross gaps?  Options:
    - they don't
    - rare, long-distance dispersal (can't be that rare)
    - living for a bit in poor, intervening habitat
    - gaps don't stay gaps for long
