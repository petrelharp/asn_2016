# Adaptation to changing environments across real geographies

This is a talk that I gave at the American Society of Naturalists meeting in January, 2016.
You can see the slides online at [this link](http://petrelharp.github.io/asn_2016/asn-2016-talk.slides.html).
The simulations use [this R package](http://github.com/petrelharp/landsim).
